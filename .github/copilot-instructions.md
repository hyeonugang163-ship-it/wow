# Copilot Instructions for AI Agents

This codebase currently contains minimal or no source files, and no project-specific documentation or conventions were found. As the project evolves, update this file to guide AI agents on:

- The overall architecture and major components
- Key developer workflows (build, test, debug)
- Project-specific conventions, patterns, or naming schemes
- Integration points and external dependencies
- Any non-obvious decisions or workflows

**Current State:**
- No README, agent instructions, or code files detected
- Only a single empty file: `boat`

**Next Steps:**
- As you add code, document important patterns and workflows here
- Reference key files and directories as they are created

_Example section to update later:_

```
## Architecture Overview
- `src/`: Main application code
- `tests/`: Test suite and fixtures
- `scripts/`: Developer utilities

## Developer Workflows
- Build: `make build`
- Test: `pytest`
- Lint: `flake8 src/`
```

Please update this file as the project grows to maximize AI agent productivity.
